## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Language Note (ATTENTION)

**All documentation, including Markdown files and detailed explanations within this repository, is written exclusively in Portuguese.**

This choice was made to provide a cdlearer, more accessible structure for the primary user. **English translation will not be provided for the main content.**

I, Rafael, strongly discourage the translation of MarkDown files within the project since it is not guaranteed to be accurate (straight to the point).
